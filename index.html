    <h3>cool web page</h3>
    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells web browsers how to display text, images, links, and other elements on a webpage. HTML uses a system of tags, such as <h1>, <p>, <a>, and <div>, to mark up content and define its role or appearance on the page.

Every HTML document begins with a basic structure, including the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, followed by <html>, <head>, and <body> tags. The head section contains metadata like the page title and links to stylesheets, while the body holds the actual content visible to users. HTML is not a programming language but rather a markup language used to organize content.

HTML works hand-in-hand with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to style web pages and with JavaScript to make them interactive. While HTML structures the page, CSS controls how it looks, and JavaScript controls how it behaves. This trio forms the foundation of almost every website on the internet today.

Learning HTML is an essential first step for anyone interested in web development or design. Itâ€™s simple to understand and write, yet powerful enough to create complex page layouts. With just a basic knowledge of HTML, you can build your own web pages and start exploring the world of web technologies.
